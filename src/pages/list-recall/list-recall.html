  <h4 style="text-align:center">About<br></h4>

  <p>List Recall is designed to improve your memory by having you remember words from a list. Since our brains are
    best at remembering visual images, one of the best ways to go about this is by using the Link Method. To use this
    method, imagine the first word in a scenario of your choosing. For example, if the first word is "dog", you can
    visualize a dog you know. Then, link every other word to the previous word. Following the example, if the second word
    is "stick", you might imagine the dog carrying the stick in its mouth. Then, if the third word is "man", you might
    imagine a man trying to take the stick from the dog.<br><br></p>

  <h4 style="text-align:center">How to play<br></h4>

  <p>A list of 50 words will appear on the screen. You have 2 minutes to memorize as many of the words as you can.
   After the 2 minutes are up, you have 2 minutes to type in as many of those words as you can. When you type a correct word, the
   yellow bar will turn green. When you type a word that you have already tried, the yellow bar will turn red. Typing in duplicate or incorrect
   words will not count against your score.</p>
